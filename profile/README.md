## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We have built a blockchain-based forest preservation crowdsourcing platform for fractionalized land ownership.
This platform was built with React for the frontend and a Ktor backend written in Kotlin. Additionally, we used a Postgres database and Firebase for user authentication.
For the blochain aspect, we leveraged Hedera to build a distributed public ledger as well as the Pinata API for implementing distributed data
storage (IPFS) for listing images and metadata.
